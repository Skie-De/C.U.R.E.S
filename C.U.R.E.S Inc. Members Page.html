                    <p></p>What is C.U.R.E.S?
                    C.U.R.E.S Incorporation, founded by Skie Degale, Ashley Hamilton Jr, Tristan Paul, Isaiah Bennett, and Uriel Wilson. We created the name C.U.R.E.S as a representation of ‚ÄúConsciously Using Resources Efficiently for Space,‚Äù
                    
                    What do we plan to do? (Business Overview)
                    C.U.R.E.S Incorporation is an innovative space technology company located in Brooklyn, New York used to manufacture Space Suits to benefit space exploration in our current age of Space Enlightenment. Space Suits are a big part of Space Exploration, however, the manufacturers never think about the people other than the country‚Äôs standard and must change to be more accessible for Space Explorationists. With C.U.R.E.S, we will impact our people that truly have the desire to explore Space just as we do, with our stupendous Space Suits. 
                    
                    Services: (Product)
                    At C.U.R.E.S, we are creating new Space Suits for civilians who aspire to explore Space, while still being affordable. We will produce superlative quality spacesuits that are made from accessible materials. 
                    
                    Why should I, an Investor, invest in your suits?
                    A very important reason, as an investor, you should invest in our Space Suits because of its unique qualities. An average Space Suit has two main components, a pressure garment, and a life support system, but for a better perspective, our Space Suits contain more innovative features/qualities. The question frequently being asked might be, ‚ÄúA Space Suit, does this mean it has weapons?‚Äù Although innovative, as a safe innovative Incorporation, our Space Suits do not contain any illegal weaponry for self-defense or destruction. Our ‚ÄúC.U.R.E.S,‚Äù Space Suits are truly a new view on the devices, used to help with Space Exploration, therefore, an investment in our company will benefit both yourself and our Incorporation.  We propagate love and peace in the heart and mind by making known a new horizon for the being that is space and for humanity. 
                    
                    
                    
                    Customer Focus: (Demographic Trend)
                    We plan to serve the black community because of the racial disparities in our society and the gulf between the education of space technology. Our focus does not change the race, age, or wealth of people who can purchase our Space Suits. ‚ÄúCan children go to Space in your suits?‚Äù Although the knowledge of Space Exploration for the black community in schools is extremely limited, the probability of a child (Infant to ages 13 - 17) surviving the immense energy outside of the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere, or the launch, is low. To lower the endangerment of children, and their immediate manual involvement in Space at an immensely young age, our Space Suits are not to be worn in Space, by children, unless in an event of a Global Warming or Nuclear Crisis that tremendously impacts the world's youth or economic state. 
                    
                    *Space Suits are expensive, therefore our Space Suits prices can alter depending on one‚Äôs situation.* 
                    
                    Financial Highlights: 
                    $250 million to proceed with the Business (Start Up Capital)
                    As an advanced business assisting in Space Exploration, in New York City, we plan to help our community through this technological advancement of Space Exploration. This budget consists of the following:
                    
                    20 Million for each suit *Production* (15 layers of material per suit, and with additional abilities.)
                    Compact oxygen converter (Tank) located in the Helmet rather than the back
                    Body temperature regulation
                    Less bulky 
                    Not restricted to ignorance of a singular design 
                    (We plan to have 7 different designs available for purchase.) 
                    Better resistance and stronger materials
                    Communication Alternatives implemented in the Suit (Camera, etc)
                    Easy movement from points A - B
                    
                    We plan to sell each suit for 25 Million.
                    This number was chosen for a 72% increase in Profits.
                    
                    The average salary for Space Suit Pattern Maker at companies like SpaceX and NASA in the United States is $117,409 as of February 27, 2023, but the range typically falls between $104,232 and $130,586. However, we plan to sell 10 Space Suits in the first year and pay our top employees $150,000 per year. 
                    
                    Our Product is not for resale. 
                    What Are Spacesuits Anyways?
                    Space Suits are pressurized garments that astronauts wear while in space. It is intended to shield them from potentially hazardous conditions encountered in space such as Micrometeoroids. They are typically constructed from nylon, spandex, other synthetic polymers, and liquid cooling tubes. 
                    
                    What are Synthetic Polymers?
                    Synthetic polymers are derived from petroleum oil, and made by scientists and engineers. Examples of synthetic polymers include nylon, polyethylene, polyester, Teflon, and epoxy. Natural polymers occur in nature and can be extracted. They are often water-based.
                    
                    
                    Success Factors:
                    C.U.R.E.S Incorporation is uniquely qualified to succeed to due to the following reasons:
                    
                    There is currently no BLACK-OWNED Space Suit business that is innovative and is thinking about the current advancement of society.
